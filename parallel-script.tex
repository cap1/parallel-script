\section{Introduction} % (fold)
\label{sec:introduction}
	The computing power has been growing ever since the first integrated circuit,
	but it has an ultimate limit: the speed of light.
	The performance of microprocessors has been increasing by 50\% each year from 1986 till 2002.
	Since then the rate has decreased to only about 20\% per year.
	This gain in performance resulted in the reduction of the size of integrated circuits.
	But as ICs become more dense for faster processing,
	they also consume more power and therefore generate more unwanted heat.
	To overcome the need for higher clock-rates,
	whom are needed to increase the performance on single core processing units,
	one is using multiple cores instead.
	With this parallelism, computers can gain in performance.

	Parallel Computing and Distributed Computing may sound similar 
	but differ in the fact that parallel computing only tries to solve one problem,
	where distributed computing is interested in solving a set of problems.
	Although they share some problems likes synchronization,
	communication, consistency and problem decomposition.
	Usually also software needs to fitted for parallel approaches,
	as algorithms can be solved in different ways
	and running of multiple instances of serial code is not very useful in most cases.
